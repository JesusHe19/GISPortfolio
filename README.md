# GIS Portfolio
This is my portfolio for the Advanced GIS class at Carnegie Mellon University.

**About me*** 
I am a Mexican Fulbright Scholar, currently a 2nd-year student of MSc Public Policy Data Analytics candidate at Heinz College. I am interested in evidence-based policymaking for the energy transition in emerging economies. Before Heinz, I completed a BSc in Chemical Engineering and Sustainability at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico. I worked at Korber AG Inhouse Consulting for the machinery industry; and the Institute for Energy Efficiency in the Production (Fraunhofer IPA).

Between undergrad and CMU, I worked at the German Development Agency in Mexico. The topics I worked on were related to Mexicoâ€™s Electromobility Strategy, the renewal of NDC, and Grant Agreements for energy efficiency in MSMEs.


**What I hope to learn**
I expect to learn how to use GIS visualization and analysis tools to create products that improve decision-making in sustainability issues. For instance, leverage visualizations to identify underserved areas. Also, I am interested in understanding good practices about project management for GIS-based applications.
